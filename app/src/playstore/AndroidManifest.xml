    Play Store Flavor Manifest
    Removes permissions that are not allowed for Play Store distribution:
    - REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES: Not needed since Play Store handles updates
    
    Note: QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES is kept because it's needed for the app drawer feature.
    You'll need to declare this in Play Console with justification:
    "Core functionality - launcher/home screen app that displays installed apps"
    -->
    
    <!-- Remove self-update related permission for Play Store -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES"
        tools:node="remove" />
