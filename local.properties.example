# MosqueClock Backend API Configuration
# Choose the appropriate configuration for your deployment:

# 1. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Android Emulator accessing host machine)
mosque_clock_api_url="http://10.0.2.2:8000/"

# 2. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (Physical device on same network)
# Replace 192.168.1.100 with your computer's local IP address
# mosque_clock_api_url="http://192.168.1.100:8000/"

# 3. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (Your deployed server)
# Replace with your actual server URL
# mosque_clock_api_url="https://your-api-domain.com/"

# 4. STAGING/TEST ENVIRONMENT
# mosque_clock_api_url="https://staging-api.your-domain.com/"

# MosqueClock API Key
# This should match the API_KEY in your backend environment configuration
# Default key for development (change this in production!)
mosque_clock_api_key="mosque-clock-api-key-2025"

# Production API Key (uncomment and use in production)
# mosque_clock_api_key="your-secure-production-api-key"

# Additional Notes:
# - For Android emulator: Use 10.0.2.2 to access host machine's localhost
# - For physical device: Use your computer's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
# - For production: Use your deployed server's domain with HTTPS
# - Always use HTTPS in production for security
# - Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
